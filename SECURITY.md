- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information sharing
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to browser APIs

### Content Security Policy

Our CSP policy restricts:
- Script execution to same-origin and inline scripts (required for structured data)
- Style loading to same-origin and Google Fonts
